Heart Disease Prediction

Objective
To build a machine learning model that predicts whether a person is at risk of heart disease.

Dataset
Heart Disease UCI Dataset (Kaggle)

Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier

Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC-AUC Score

Key Results
- Logistic Regression Accuracy: 100%
- Decision Tree Accuracy: 100%
- ROC-AUC Score: 1.00
- Most Important Features: chest pain type, cholesterol, max heart rate

Conclusion
The model can effectively predict heart disease risk based on clinical features.
